                Here's an example chart using

                ðŸ“ˆ <strong>Highcharts</strong> is a super-flexible library for
                creating all kinds of charts. See demos of different chart types
                <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we're using Highcharts through Svelte, the syntax is a
                little different from what you might see in the demos. But all
                of Highcharts' functionality is available through the Highcharts
                for Svelte package.
            </p>
            <p>
                The configuration is done through the
                <code>options</code> json object passed to the chart, which you'll
                see in the source code for this template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the
                <a href="https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/"
                    >API reference</a
                >
                to understand what each element in the <code>options</code> object
                does.

                Redlining goes beyond just preventing African Americans from getting housing. It can also prevent getting access to good schools and having good education.
